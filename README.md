> All the technical documentations and schemes.

[Specifications board](https://github.com/HETIC-MT-P2021/CQRSES_GROUP3/projects/1)
> All the Epic and User stories

[Application board](https://github.com/HETIC-MT-P2021/CQRSES_GROUP3/projects/2)
> All the technical tasks

## Specification process

1. The process follow a simple logic: first we create an Epic issue in the [specifications board](https://github.com/HETIC-MT-P2021/CQRSES_GROUP3/projects/1) to reference all the correspondent User/Dev-Stories. Some of them are focused for developers, others for users.
2. Those Epic issues will be described with their initiatives and goals and captures a large amount of work granularized into User/Dev-stories.
3. Then the User/Dev-stories will be created with the desired behaviour for a specific feature.
4. Finally, the User/Dev-stories will be breakdown into technical tasks referenced as feature request in the issues list.

> All of those issues follow the stages `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done`

## Development process

1. Most of the time a ticket on the [application board](https://github.com/HETIC-MT-P2021/CQRSES_GROUP3/projects/2) in the `Todo` column is assign to a team member.
2. When a member starts working on the ticket, he should move the concerned ticket to `In Progress`.
3. Then he creates a branch specifically for this ticket with a name that follows the [conventions specified below](#branch-naming-convention).
4. Commit regularly at each significant step with unambiguous commit messages (see [COMMIT_CONVENTIONS](COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md) file).
5. Create a merge request that follows the [conventions specified below](#pull-requests-pr) to the develop branch.
6. On the [application board](https://github.com/HETIC-MT-P2021/CQRSES_GROUP3/projects/2), move the ticket to the status `In Review`
7. Assign the merge request to a maintainer
8. It may take some back and forth before your pull request will be validated
9. Your pull request will be then merged into develop branch and the concerned ticket will be moved to `Done`

## Tests

You can run tests using the `make test` command.

## Branch naming convention

You branch should have a name that reflects it's purpose.

It should use the same guidelines as [COMMIT_CONVENTIONS](COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md) (`feat`, `fix`, `build`, `perf`, `docs`), followed by an underscore (`_`) and a very quick summary of the subject in [kebab case][1].

Example: `feat_add-image-tag-database-relation`.

## Pull requests (PR)

Pull requests in this project follow two conventions, you will need to use the templates available in the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) folder :

- Adding a new feature should use the [FEATURE_REQUEST](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/FEATURE_REQUEST.md) template.
- Reporting a bug should use the [BUG_REPORT](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template.

If your pull request is still work in progress, please add "WIP: " (Work In Progress) in front of the title, therefor you inform the maintainers that your work is not done, and we can't merge it.

The naming of the PR should follow the same rules as the [COMMIT_CONVENTIONS](COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md)

## Linter

We use go linter [gofmt](https://blog.golang.org/gofmt) to automatically formats the source code.
